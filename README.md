# Task 2 :- Creating A Snake Game Using Python
## Snake Game By "Syed Sameer Ahamed"
### Introduction:-
The Snake Game is a classic arcade game in which the player controls a snake on a bordered plane. The snake moves around the screen, consuming food and growing in length. The objective is to avoid colliding with the boundaries of the screen or the snake's own body.
### Requirements:-
To create the Snake Game, you'll need the following:
1. Programming language: Choose Python Programming language that supports graphics and user input. include Python with libraries like Pygame.
2. Graphics library: You'll need a graphics library that allows you to draw and update the game screen. This library should support basic shapes, such as rectangles and circles, and provide functions for handling user input.
3. Game logic: Implement the game logic, including the movement of the snake, collision detection, scoring, and game over conditions.
4. User input: Set up controls for the player to interact with the game. Typically, arrow keys or WASD keys are used to control the snake's movement.
### Game Development Steps:-
Follow these steps to create the Snake Game:-
#### 1. Set up the game screen:
- Create a window or canvas with a fi xed size to serve as the game screen.
- Set up the necessary libraries and modules to handle graphics and user input.
#### 2. Initialize the game:-
- Set the initial position and size of the snake.
- Generate the fi rst food item on the game screen.
- Set the initial score and any other game variables.
#### 3. Game loop:-
- Create a loop that continuously updates the game state and redraws the game
screen.
- Within the loop, handle user input to control the snake's movement.
- Update the snake's position based on user input and perform collision detection.
#### 4. Collision detection:-
- Check for collisions between the snake's head and the boundaries of the game
screen.
- Check for collisions between the snake's head and its own body.
- Check for collisions between the snake's head and the food item.
#### 5. Game over condition:-
- If the snake collides with a boundary or its own body, end the game.
- Display the fi nal score and provide an option to restart the game.
#### 6. Game mechanics:-
- Implement the snake's movement and growth mechanism.
- Update the score when the snake consumes food.
- Increase the game's di culty over time (optional).
#### 7. Game graphics:-
- Draw the snake's body, head, and food items on the game screen.
- Update the screen with each game loop iteration to show changes.
#### 8. Testing:-
- Test the game thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected.

### Conclusion:-
By following these steps, you can create a simple Snake Game that allows users to
control a snake and navigate it through obstacles. The game provides an excellent
opportunity to work with graphics, user input, game logic, and basic collision
detection. Have fun coding and experimenting with di erent features to make the
game even more engaging and challenging.
